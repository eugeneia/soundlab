{SOUNDLAB} is a tool I designed to explore sound synthesis.

It makes projecting ideas through speakers easy.

Its much like writing a script for the speaker.

Imagine I would hand out colorful glass shards and distorting mirrors so
you can mess around with the beamer. That's the visual counterpart of
{SOUNDLAB}.
