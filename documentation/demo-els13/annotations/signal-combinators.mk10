+ Let's say we want to implement a function {CHORD}.
+ The first implementation is fairly straight forward thanks to the
  {LOOP} macro.
+ This gets complicated really fast.
+ The second implementation uses the signal combinator approach
+ It reuses two combinators {DIVIDE} and {ADD} and a primitive signal
  {FLATLINE}.
+ It's based on a common interface which grants composability and
  reuseability.
