This demonstration explores an intuitive approach to signal synthesis
using \textit{Higher-order functions} to compute \textit{lazy}
representations of signals. Given a few primitives which adhere to said
representation, ad hoc combinations of signals can be formed to be used
to synthesize new signals intuitively. Results from an experimental
implementation of this approach in an embedded\footnote{Embedded in
\textit{Common Lisp}, that is.} signal synthesis language called
\texttt{SOUNDLAB} prove the approach to be powerful and extensible.
