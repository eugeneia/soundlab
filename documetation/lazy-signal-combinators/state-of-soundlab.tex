\section{The state of \sectt{SOUNDLAB}}

As of the time of this writing \texttt{SOUNDLAB} consists of roughly 500
lines of source code. It depends on a minimal library for writing
\texit{WAVE} files and is written entirely in \textit{Common Lisp}. The
source code is fairly well documented and frugal.

While being compact \texttt{SOUNDLAB} provides basic routines for working
with western notes and tempo, a few primitive waveforms, \textit{ADSR}
envelopes with customizable slopes and the ability to form arbitrary
waveforms from envelopes, a good handfull of signal combinators and last
but not least an experimental lowpass filter. A stable API is nowhere
near in sight but some trends in design are becoming clear.

On the roadmap are classic sound synthesis features like resonance,
routines for importing signals from \textit{WAVE} files and many small
but essential details like bezier curved slopes for envelopes.
