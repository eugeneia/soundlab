The described approach is mainly inspired from experience gained by using
analogue sound synthesizers. While every analogue synthesizer has its own
unique sound based on the physical parts it is made of, most do share
their key concepts. Usually a limited number oscillators generate signals
resembling --- more or less --- sine waves which are then modulated by
being combined with each other in a number of ways.

\texttt{SOUNDLAB} --- an experimental implementation of the approach ---
is designed to enable the user to explore ways of signal combination. It
does so by defining an embdedded \textit{domain specific language} which
provides axioms that generate primitive signals and axioms that combine
arbitrary signals forming new signals. Furthermore \texttt{SOUNDLAB}
allows the use of \textit{Common Lisp's} means of abstraction to define
compound signals and signal combinators. Primitive as well as compound
parts of the system form a homogenous group of objects defined by their
shared interfaces, which grant the system power and flexibility similar
to a \textit{Lisp} system.

There are of course many free software implementations\footnote{TODO:
Reference.} of signal synthesis systems with programming language 
interfaces. However, most concentrate on integration with graphical
interfaces and none of these integrate tightly with \textit{Common Lisp}
to reuse its powerful means of abstraction.
